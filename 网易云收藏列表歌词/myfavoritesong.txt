（花谢花飞飞满天
红消香断有谁怜
游丝软系飘春榭
落絮轻沾扑绣帘）
一年三百六十日
风刀霜剑严相逼
明媚鲜妍能几时
一朝漂泊难寻觅
（花开易见落难寻
阶前愁煞葬花人
独倚花锄偷洒泪
洒上空枝见血痕
愿奴胁下生双翼
随花飞到天尽头）
天尽头
何处有香丘
天尽头
何处有香丘
（未若锦囊收艳骨
一抔净土掩风流
质本洁来还洁去
强于污淖陷渠沟）
尔今死去侬收葬
未卜侬身何日丧
侬今葬花人笑痴
他年葬侬知是谁
天尽头
何处有香丘
天尽头
何处有香丘
（试看春残花渐落
便是红颜老死时
一朝春尽红颜老

那时我还是个小孩子
最喜欢的就是和弟弟去河边玩耍
外公身体不行了躺在床上
妈妈的手破了却还在不停的干活

那年我五岁 妈妈对我说
多学点东西长大了做一个好人
那年我五岁 妈妈对我说
多学点东西长大了做一个好人
那年我五岁
我的爸爸妈妈已经走了
每当夜晚来临都会想念他们
我多想他们依旧在身旁
多想放学的时候拉着他们的手回家

那年我五岁 爸爸对我说
对不起孩子我不能再照顾你了
那年我五岁 妈妈对我说
对不起宝贝 姐姐也要和我一起走了
那年我五岁
还记得去年夏天那么快乐
第一次爸爸妈妈带我去旅游
可没过多久奶奶就突然走了
没有她的日子我到底该怎么过
那年我五岁 爸爸对我说
要好好学习 做一个有出息的人
那年我五岁 爸爸对我说
要好好学习 做一个有出息的人
那年我五岁
那天放学我回到家里
妈妈说爷爷病的快不行了
我疯了一样冲出去找爷爷
可耳边突然传来了海螺号的声音

那年我五岁 妈妈对我说
爷爷一直在小声地喊我的名字
那年我五岁 妈妈对我说
爷爷一直在小声地喊我的名字
那年我五岁
有一天妈妈生下了弟弟
他那么漂亮可爱惹人开心
可五岁那年医生告诉我们
他无法听到这世上所有美妙的声音
那年我五岁 弟弟对我说
告诉我哥哥为什么我听不到声音
那年我五岁 弟弟对我说
告诉我哥哥为什么我听不到声音
那年我五岁
时光匆匆慢慢我们也会变老
也会活到亲人离世时的那般年岁
回首往事终于明白他们叮咛的
所有那些平淡无味的话语
那年我五岁 爸爸对我说
学一点东西否则你会一事无成
那年我五岁 爸爸对我说
学一点东西否则你会一事无成
那年我五岁 爸爸对我说
学一点东西否则你会一事无成
那年我五岁 爸爸对我说
不要哭孩子长大了你就会明白
那年我五岁

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was 7 years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was 11 years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old
(Lukas Graham!!!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Once I was seven years old, my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old
Once I was seven years oldSpringsteen-Eric Church
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standing there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
flip-flops and cut off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm On Fire and Born To Run
You looked at me and I was done
we were just getting started
I was singing to you
you were singing to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang oh

Stayed there 'til they forced us out
We took the long way to your house
And I can still hear the sound
Of you saying, "Don't go"
When I think about you
I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
......
I bumped in to you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name
I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
and this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your momma think '
bout your name on my arm
Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of the drummer
You hear sometimes late at night on your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born In The USA
Do you relive those glory days from so long ago

When you think about me
Do you think about 17
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night

Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohMy chances weren't good she was way out of my reach
How could she ever fall for some ol' boy like me
But here she lies asleep tonight in these arms of mine
And that goes to show angels fall sometimes
She's been here long enough to see that I'm no saint by now
Every mornin' I wake surprised to find her still around
The love that she give to me could be no truer sign
Every now and then angels fall sometimes
She brings pieces of heaven every day into my life
She's been my inspiration with her by my side

I'm not afraid to dream high
---- Instrumental Interlude ----

The love that she gives to me could be no truer sign
Every now and then angels fall sometimes
Yeah, I thank the Lord angels fall sometimes

If I could write a letter to me
And send it back in time to myself at 17
First I\'d prove it\'s me by saying look under your bed
There\'s a Skoal can and a Playboy no one else would know you hid

And then I\'d say I know it\'s tough
When you break up after seven months
And yeah I know you really liked her and it just don\'t seem fair

All I can say is pain like that is fast and it\'s rare

And oh you got so much going for you going right
But I know at 17 it\'s hard to see past Friday night
She wasn\'t right for you
And still you feel like there\'s a knife sticking out of your back

And you\'re wondering if you\'ll survive
You\'ll make it through this and you\'ll see
You\'re still around to write this letter to me

At the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth
Always stop completely don\'t just tap your breaks
And when you get a date with Bridgett make sure the tank is full

On second thought forget it that one turns out kinda cool
Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you\'re wrong and dad is right
And you really should thank Mrs. Brinkman
She spent so much extra time

It\'s like she sees the diamond underneath
And she\'s just polishin\' you \'til you shine

And oh you got so much going for you going right
But I know at 17 it\'s hard to see past Friday night
Tonight\'s the bonfire rally
But you\'re staying home instead because if you fail Algebra

Mom and dad will kill you dead
Trust me you\'ll squeak by and get a C
And you\'re still around to write this letter to me

You\'ve got so much up ahead
You\'ll make new friends
You should see your kids and wife
And I\'d end by saying have no fear
These are nowhere near the best years of your life

I guess I\'ll see you in the mirror
When you\'re a grown man
P.S. go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can

And oh you got so much going for you going right
But I know at 17 it\'s hard to see past Friday night
I wish you\'d study Spanish
I wish you\'d take a typing class
I wish you wouldn\'t worry, let it be
I\'d say have a little faith and you\'ll see

If I could write a letter to me
To me作曲 : John Osborne/TJ Osborne/Craig Wiseman
 作词 : John Osborne/TJ Osborne/Craig Wiseman
Now and then I think about you now and then
When I see that Chevrolet
That certain shade, of blue
I hear that song, the one we sang all summer long
and even though its been so long it brings me back,
right back to you

I hope you find the storm that you were chasing,
hope your eyes are still full of dreams
as they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
when I hear the sound of high tide thunder,
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me,
yeah you made a man of me

How yah been I'd love to hear bout how you been
you're the only broken heart I've ever had and love to have again

I hope you find the storm that you were chasing,
hope your eyes are still full of dreams
as they were that night when you slipped off those cut off jeans
when I hear the sound of high tide thunder,
I can see your hair blowing in the breeze
I think about how you and that 21 summer made a man of me,
yeah you made a man of me
yeah you made a man of me无歌词作曲 : 赵雷

我走在鼓楼下面 路在堵着
雨后的阳光洒落 人们都出来了

执着的迷惘的文艺青年很多
如果我无聊了就会来这里坐坐

我是个沉默不语的靠着墙壁晒太阳的过客
如果我有些倦意了 就让我在这里独自醒过
我站在鼓楼上面 一切繁华与我无关
这是个拥挤的地方  而我却很平凡

我走在鼓楼下面 淋湿的咖啡馆
睡不着的后海边 月亮还在抽着烟
喝醉的亲吻着 快活的人不眠
唯有我倚着围栏 对过往说晚安

我是个沉默不语的靠着车窗想念你的乘客
当107路再次经过 时间是带走青春的电车
我站在什剎海边一切甜蜜与我无关
这是个拥挤的地方 而我却很孤单

这是1999年的冬天
从来没经历过的寒冷
街边的楼群指着蓝天
人们都蜷缩在大衣里行色匆匆
我坐在深蓝色的车里
摇摇晃晃行驶在狂野的城市
突然这一切都将消失
祛色的幻梦退色的爱
再见，二十世纪
再见，我一样迷茫的人们

阿甘说生活是一块巧克力
我想也许他是对的
一个女人说生活是孩子和房子
我想也许她也是对的
上帝说生活是求恕和忏悔
我想也许我是个罪人
我从五岁歌唱到现在已苍老
现在还是两手空空像粒尘土
再见，二十世纪
再见，我一样迷茫的人们
再见，二十世纪
再见，我一样迷茫的人们

还有一点点时间用来回忆
还有一点点时间用来哭泣
善良的人们行走在荡动的荒野
祈祷着的号角从街道传来
猛的瓦解及裂碎黎明的炊烟
云和雾遮住我的双眼
这是一个美丽的结局
没有危险没有恐惧
再见二十世纪
再见和我一样迷茫的人们

夜深了风吹得我很冷
全城的人们都涌向爆炸
伤囚和士兵做着同样的游戏
游戏的花车载着疯狂
这时子夜的钟声已经响起
突然间我绝望浑身紧缩
我多想再抓紧妈妈的手
可是太晚了
钟声已响起
再见二十世纪
再见和我一样迷茫的人们

Didn't think before deciding what to do

Ooh, that talk of opportunities, TV breaks and movies

Rang true, sure rang true ...
Seems it never rains in southern California

Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
It never rains in California, but girl, don't they warn ya?

It pours, man, it pours

I'm out of work, I'm out of my head

Out of self respect, I'm out of bread

I'm underloved, I'm underfed, I wanna go home
It never rains in California, but girl, don't they warn ya?

It pours, man, it pours

Will you tell the folks back home I nearly made it?

Had offers but didn't know which one to take

Please don't tell them how you found me
Don't tell 'em how you found me

Give me a break, give me a break

Seems it never rains in southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before

It never rains in California, but girl, don't they warn ya?

It pours, man, it pourIf you miss the train I'm on,
You will know that I am gone,
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles.
A hundred miles, a hundred miles,
A hundred miles, A hundred miles,
You can hear the whistle blow A hundred miles.
Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two, Lord,
I'm three, Lord, I'm four, Lord,
I'm five hundred miles away from home.
Away from home, away from home,
away from home, away from home,
Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home
Not a shirt on my back,
Not a penny to my name.
Lord. I can't go back home this-a way.
This-a way, this-a way,
This-a way, this-a way,
Lord, I can't go back home this-a way.
If you miss the train I'm on,
You will know that I am gone,
You can hear the whistle blow A hundred miles.
A hundred miles.
A hundred miles.
A hundred miles.
A hundred miles.
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred milesWhen the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
I could offer a warm embrace
to make you feel my love
When evening shadows and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
but I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind where you belong
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
Oh there's nothing that I wouldn't do
to make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
and on the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free
you ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy,
make your dreams come true
nothing that I wouldn't do
go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my loveAlabama - Happy Birthday Jesus
Happy birthday,Jesus
it's that time of year
All the lights on the trees say
Christmas time is near
Another year's behind us
you helped us make it through
So, happy birthday,Jesus

We all get so hung up
on material things
at times it seems like we forget
what Christmas really means
It should be thanks we're givin',
that's why I wrote this tune
Happy brithday,Jesus
this song is just for you
There's a gift for everyone but you underneath the tree
No, it's not much,

北方的村庄住着一个南方的姑娘
她总是喜欢穿着带花的裙子站在路旁
她的话不多但笑起来是那么平静悠扬
她柔弱的眼神里装的是什么 是思念的忧伤
南方的小镇阴雨的冬天没有北方冷
她不需要臃肿的棉衣去遮盖她似水的面容
她在来去的街头留下影子芳香在回眸人的心头
眨眼的时间芳香已飘散影子已不见
南方姑娘 你是否习惯北方的秋凉
南方姑娘 你是否喜欢北方人的直爽
日子过的就像那些不眠的晚上
她嚼着口香糖对墙满谈着理想
南方姑娘 我们都在忍受着漫长
南方姑娘 是不是高楼遮住了你的希望

昨日的雨曾淋漓过她瘦弱的肩膀
夜空的北斗也没有让她找到迷途的方向
阳光里她在院子中央晾晒着衣裳
在四季的风中她散着头发安慰着时光
南方姑娘 你是否爱上了北方
南方姑娘 你说今天你就要回到你的家乡
思念让人心伤 她呼唤着你的泪光
南方的果子已熟 那是最简单的理想

谁料皇榜中状元

帽插宫花好啊 好新鲜

不过是情而已
这人间苦什么
怕不能遇见你
这世界有点假
可我莫名爱上她

On a dark desert highway
cool wind in my hair
warm smell of colitas
rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
there she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
and I was thinking to myself
this could be heaven or this could be hell
then she lift it up a candle
and she showed me the way
there were voice down in corridor
I thought I heard them say.....
welcome to the hotel California
such a lovely place
such a lovely face
plenty of rooms at the hotel California
any time of year
you can find it here
her mind is Tiffany-twisted
she got the Mercedes bends
she got a lot of pretty pretty boys
that she calls friends
how they dance in the courtyard
sweet summers sweat
some dance to remember some dance to forget
so I called up the captain
please bring me my wine, he said:"
we haven't had that spirit
here since nineteen sixty nine
and still those voises are calling from far away
wake up in the middle of the night
just to hear them say....
welcome to the hotel California
such a lovely place
such a lovely face
they live in'it up in the hotel California
what nice surprise
bring your alibis
mirrors on the celling
the pink champagne on ice,and she said:"
we are all just prisoners here
of our own device
and in the master's chambers

they stab it with their steely knives
but they just can't kill the beast
last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back
to the place I was before

but you can never leave作词 : JACKSON, ALAN
Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when

Remember when we vowed the vows
and walked the walk
gave our hearts made the start it was hard
We lived and learned life threw curves
There was joy there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed disassembled rearranged
We came together fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

Remember when the sound of little feet
was the music

We danced to week to week
Brought back the love we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookin' back it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are
where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when

Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad we'll be glad
For all the life we've had

And we'll remember when

Remember when

Remember when作词 : Hall
Have a little love on a little honeymoon
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard
A Little bitty dog and a little bitty car
Well it's all right to be a little bitty
A Little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while
A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
It'll grow up in a little bitty town
Big yellow bus and little bitty books
It all started with a little bitty book
Well it's alright to be little bitty
A Little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while
You know you got a job and a little bitty check
A six pack of beer and a television set
Little bitty world goes around and around
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound
A good ole boy and a pretty little girl
Start all over in a little bitty world
A little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
It's all part of a little bitty scheme
Well it's all right to be a little bitty
A Little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while
Well it's all right to be a little bitty
A Little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while走着走着，天就亮了
喝着喝着，酒又醒了
看看来时的路，离过去已几光年
一直从四环到积水潭
实在不知该怎么去拒绝你
如同拒绝这场，四月的雨
我拍拍你的肩膀说
“就送到这里吧”
前面的路让我一个人走完
我看见黎明即将来临
广场上人们将红旗慢慢升起
我只好将我的理想收进行囊
乘今晚的列车回远方
亲爱的今天我就要离开北京
让我最后一次，最后一次说爱你
亲爱的今天我就要离开北京
让我最后一眼，最后一眼再看你
我看见黎明即将来临
广场上人们将红旗慢慢升起
我只好将我的理想收进行囊
乘今晚的列车回远方
亲爱的今天我就要离开北京
让我最后一次，最后一次说爱你
亲爱的今天我就要离开北京
让我最后一眼，最后一眼再看你
亲爱的今天我就要离开北京
让我最后一次，最后一次说爱你
亲爱的今天我就要离开北京
让我最后一眼，最后一眼再看你
北京Girl, you shine like a brand new dime,
Like a song in rhyme I can sing to.
I bet them boy'd all stand in line
So they can take you out and try to win you.
.
My boots and jeans don't go so well
With a white table cloth in a ritzy hotel
No, I'm used to much simpler things
So baby, climb on in this truck,
I'll show you what I mean.
.
I wanna love you on a Silverado bench seat,
Fogging up the windows while we're far down by the creek.
No other light beside the stars and the moon
That's what you get when this country boy loves you.
.
A girl like you is just so pretty,
You've been winding down all over this town.
I wanna take you far from the city,
Back on up a back road and watch the sun go down.
.
I wanna love you on a Silverado bench seat,
Fogging up the windows while we're far down by the creek.
No other light beside the stars and the moon
That's what you get when this country boy loves you.
.
And we'll see around midnight if the sky is right
How the water starts dancing in the moonlight
If you want a country boy loving you
And girl, I know you do
.
I wanna love you on a Silverado bench seat,
Fogging up the windows while we're far down by the creek.
No other light beside the stars and the moon
That's what you get when this country boy loves you.
.
When this country boy loves you
On that Silverado bench seatI'd Come For You - Nickelback
Just One more moment, that's all that's needed.
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing.
Time to be honest, this time i'm bleeding
Please don't dwell on it, cause i didn't mean it
I can't believe i said i'd
lay our love on the ground
But it doesn't matter
cause i've made it up forgive me now
Everyday i spend away my souls inside out
Gotta be someway that i can
make it up to you now, somehow.
By now you'd know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes i'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And i'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know i'd always come for you
I was blindfolded, but now i'm seeing
My mind was closing, now i'm believing
I finally know what just
what it means to let someone in
To see the side of me
that no one does or ever will
So if your ever lost
and find yourself all alone
I'd search forever just to bring you home,
Here and now this I vow
By now you'd know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes i'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And i'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know i'd always come for you
You know i'd always come for you
No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember
you know i'll always come for you
Yes i'd come for you, no one but you,
Yes i'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And i'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know i'd always come for you
No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember
you know i'll always come for you
I'd crawl acroos this world for you
Do anything you want me to
No matter what, remember
you know i'll always come for you
You know i'll always come for youOh man, you've gotta watch where you're stepping around here
Yeah I got a friend in New York City
He's never heard of Connway Twitty
Don't know nothing about grits and greens
Never been south of Queens
But he flew down here on a business trip
I took him honky tonkin' and that was it
He took to it like a pig to mud, like a cow to cud
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you gotta admit that's in them genes
Ain't nothing wrong, just getting on your
hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Nah, you ain't gotta be born out in the sticks
With an F-150 and a 30-06,
Or have a bubba in the family tree
To get on down with me
All you need is an open mind
If it fires you up you gotta let it shine
When it feels so right that it cant be wrong
Come on, come on, come on
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you gotta admit that's in them genes
Ain't nothing wrong, just getting on your
hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Come on y'all
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you gotta admit that's in them genes
Ain't nothing wrong, just getting on your
hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Hillbilly done ba-bone ba-bone bone
Hillbilly done ba-bone ba-bone boneWell the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ole Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At a honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night; what?
(That's right)
Yea, what they call work,
digging in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore rain the come down
To get paid, to get the girl

In your 4 wheel drive
(A country boy can survive)
Yea the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out,
kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs

Backwoods legit, don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco,
chew tobacco, spit

Aw heck

Red red red red red red redneck

Well boys the 'round here,

Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie
(You don't do the dougie?)
No, not in Kentucky
But these girls 'round here yep,
they still love me
Yea, the girls 'round here,
they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar,
sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that y'all and southern drawl
And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'
For the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls,
talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out,
kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs

Backwoods legit, don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco,
chew tobacco, spit
Let me hear you say
(Ooh let's ride)

Through the countryside
(Ooh let's ride)
Down to the river side
Hey now girl, hop inside
Me and you gonna take a little ride to the river
Let's ride (That's right)
Lay a blanket on the ground
Kissing and the crickets is the only sound

We out of town

Red red red red red red redneck?
And do you wanna get with down a…
Red red red red red red redneck?

Kissing and the crickets is the only sound

We out of town

Girl you gotta get down with a…

Come on through the country side

Down to the river sideThere's a moment in this journey that I gave up
My boots just couldn't walk another mile
And that cloud above me had no silver lining
I couldn't buy a break with my last dime
Oh, but when I saw you standing in the corner
I'da never thought that you would have my back
But then we rolled in like the thunder and the lightening
Threw some punches then we had a laugh
Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
Who'da thought we'd wind up here together?
It's crazy that we're standing side by side
Fighting just like two birds of a feather
Who's gonna tell us now that we can't fly?
Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
To the end you and me are gonna be friends
Yeah！
Here we go！
Hey, hey you and me
Different as different can be
You like to rock, I like to roll
You take the high and I'll take the low
Woah, woah-oh Woah, woah-oh
Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
To the end you and me are gonna be friends
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends, yeah
